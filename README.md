## How does it work?
* First generate 365 Pok&eacute;mon id's for each day of the year, and store them in an array
* Match the users birthday to the values in the array, once match is found send the id to a variable
* Make an ajax request to Pok&eacute;Api and get info about the users pok&eacute;mon id saved in the variable
* Fetch and display official artwork, and gen 5 & gen 6 sprites for users pok&eacute;mon
